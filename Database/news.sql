But that doesn''t mean you can''t plan ahead, start to envision your retirement lifestyle and begin to put pieces of the puzzle together.\r\n\r\nThere''s lots of advice, and many guidelines, to help you chart your way through retirement. Here are seven common assumptions, and the reasons why some of them are true, some are false and a few of them are in between.\r\n\r\n1. Social Security will be there for you. TRUE. Many workers in America have lost faith in Social Security, thinking the system will be bankrupt by the time they become eligible to collect their benefits. But the fact is, the current system is sound, just the way it is, for another two decades. Yes, lawmakers may make some modest cuts to extend the system. Or, if nothing gets done, there could be deeper cuts later on. But Social Security will not go bust.\r\n\r\n2. Social Security will pay the bills. FALSE. The average Social Security retirement benefit is currently $1,331 a month. That''s $15,972 per year, which happens to be the poverty line for a couple with no dependents. Meanwhile, the maximum benefit for someone at full retirement age (currently 66) is $2,685, and even for those who wait until age 70 to retire, the maximum is $3,501 a month. That sounds better, but if you qualify for the maximum benefit, you were earning over $100,000 annually, and so you''re probably not going to be happy on $32,220 a year.\r\n\r\n3. Inflation is no longer a worry. MAYBE. The pundits have declared that inflation is dead, and now actually worry about a decline in the cost of living. Last year the average consumer price index went up barely 1 percent. But remember the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation routinely came in at 5 percent or more? Even in the early 2000s, inflation chugged along at closer to 3 percent. So, $100 from the year 2000 is worth only about $72 today. If you retire at age 66, and expect to live another 20 years, $100 will then be worth only about $64 today, or maybe less.\r\n\r\n4. The stock market will pump up your income. MAYBE. The stock market has been ratcheting up since 2009, and it''s produced a lot of wealth for retirees who have invested in stocks and mutual funds. But, as recent events remind us, while the stock market is a good place to invest for the long term, it can put a pretty painful dent in your finances in the short run. So stay invested with your long-term savings, but don''t keep any money in the market that you might need in the next five years.\r\n\r\n5. You can always keep working. MAYBE. Many baby boomers express an interest in working after they retire, usually as a consultant or in a part-time job. This pans out for many people, especially those who are able to keep options open with their old company. But the fact is, only a small fraction of retired people are actually working. Why the discrepancy? Jobs are not that easy to get for people over 65, and as we hit our 70s we may find that we don''t have the interest or the stamina to continue in the labor force.\r\n\r\n6. You''ll receive an inheritance. MAYBE. But even the most affluent aging parents can be bled dry if they end up in a nursing home, especially if they don''t have long-term care insurance. The average nursing home costs several thousand dollars a month, and fees can go much higher depending on where you live and what kind of services are needed. But even without punishing care giving costs, many elderly parents live well into their 90s, and simply spend down most of their children''s inheritance.\r\n\r\n7. You can live on less money. TRUE. It doesn''t take a genius to figure out that you''ll have less money in retirement than you did when you were working. The good news is that you need less money. You will likely pay lower taxes and won''t be subject to the payroll tax. Your kids are probably grown up, so you''re not supporting them anymore. And there are many ways to cut your bills, such as downsizing your home, traveling off season and taking advantage of a wide array of senior discounts.', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1'),

Just as in Proust or Nabokov', 'TELEGRAPH.CO.UK', '2015-09-16 19:00:00', 4, 13, 0, 'john_small.jpg', 'john.jpg', '', '', 'Banville grants his narrators his own talent for descriptive language. Just as in Proust or Nabokov, past events are refracted through a glittering verbal artifice that partially redeems painful memories. When Banville gets it right, his eloquence draws you into another world. ', 'The Irish  novelist John Banville is a master of memory. His narrators are often damaged middle-aged men looking back over their lives and trying to work out what went wrong. They are also usually coping with the death of someone close, a wife or child. In Banville’s Man Booker Prize-winning The Sea (2004), the art critic Max Morden, recently widowed, visits a seaside village and reflects on a childhood trauma. In his 2012 novel Ancient Light, the actor Alex Cleave thinks back to the Fifties, when as a teenage boy he had an affair with a married woman. Recalling his erotic awakening and eventual painful separation from her is his way of distracting himself from his daughter’s death – or perhaps the two types of grief balance each other out.\r\n\r\nBanville grants his narrators his own talent for descriptive language. Just as in Proust or Nabokov, past events are refracted through a glittering verbal artifice that partially redeems painful memories. When Banville gets it right, his eloquence draws you into another world. At times, though, the heightened language can feel precious. Readers who would rather not indulge his cloudy evocations of lost time would probably get along better with his thriller-writing alter ego, Benjamin Black.\r\n\r\nBanville’s new novel, The Blue Guitar, returns to familiar ground. The narrator, Oliver Orme, is a middle-aged painter who no longer paints. His affair with Polly, his friend Marcus’s wife, has been exposed. He is surviving the buried grief after his baby daughter Olivia’s death. Unable to retreat into his art, Oliver takes refuge in wordplay. “Once I was a painter, now I’m a painster,” he writes, rounding off his bad pun with a bittersweet “Ha”.\r\n\r\nA tone of jaunty wordiness predominates in the first part of the novel. Remembering the dinner at which he first decided to seduce Polly, Oliver compares his wife, Gloria, with his mistress-to-be: “In fact, she is a Tiepolo rather than a Manet type, one of the Venetian master’s Cleopatras, say, or his Beatrice of Burgundy. To my luminous Gloria, Polly could hardly hold one of those little votive candles people used to pay a penny for in church and set burning in front of their favourite saint’s statue. Why then did I—? Ah, now, that’s the nub of the matter, one of the nubs, that I have worn everything down to.”\r\n\r\nThis passage encapsulates what some readers find irritating about Banville: the pointed references to high art (Tiepolo, Manet); the painstaking elaboration of a common phrase (to hold a candle); and the self-absorbed self-interruption (“Why then did I—?”). But is more going on here than the novelist’s typical linguistic pyrotechnics? Further on, Oliver confesses that, sitting at dinner with Polly that evening, “what I really wanted to do was to kiss her lips, to lick her eyelids, to dart the tip of my tongue into the pink and secret volutes of her ear”. That odd word “volutes” – the scroll-like curls found at the top of Greek columns – seems over the top. It reads more like a parody of Banville. This, I suspect, is a deliberate effect designed to reveal something important about the narrator. Oliver is protecting himself from the world through fancy descriptions and allusions. Language, for him, shields rather than reveals. Later on, he admits as much: “What concerns me is not things as they are, but as they offer themselves up to being expressed. The expressing is all – and oh, such expressing.”\r\n\r\nBanville is playing a dangerous game with this conceit. Some readers will have lost all sympathy with Oliver after a few dozen pages. But they should persist because, as the novel progresses, he becomes more honest about his own pain and the pain he has caused others. The verbal luxuriance fades and a powerful drama emerges.\r\n\r\nOliver dreams of his daughter, “my own little one, my lost Olivia”. She wears a “solemn, faintly questioning look, her arms pressed close to her sides, a bright figure at the centre of a vast, dark place”. Her gaze turns the attention back to Oliver. In the next scene, Polly tells him she has left her husband. He’s shocked: he thought the affair was over. Looking at her, as she dangles her own baby on her lap, “she made me think, disconcertingly, of a classic pietà – it’s what I do, I transform everything into a scene and frame it”. Now the artistic allusion is troubled rather than superior. The image of Mary with Jesus’s body emerges from his own mourning for his daughter and the two women he has abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn his 2005 acceptance speech, Banville said that it was “nice to see a work of art win the Booker Prize”. He was teasing his audience, but he was also utterly serious. This engrossing and often beautiful novel is a true work of art that rewards careful reading. After 16 novels it feels as if Banville, like one of his narrators, is looking back over what he has achieved, still probing the old subjects – the permanence of grief, the endurance of love, the value of art. In The Blue Guitar he has come up with an ingenious and moving variation on those themes.', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1');

In the great assembly at Troyes, flanked by his daughter who had been granted as a bride to the conqueror, and the councillors gathered nervously around the throne on which he had for so long been “posed like a doll”, Charles VI of France struggled to find something to say. “Oh, it’s you,” he said eventually to Henry V. “Well, since you are here, welcome!”\r\n\r\nOne of the great delights of this magnificent fourth volume of Jonathan Sumption’s The Hundred Years War is the author’s ability to pick just the right quotation to illustrate his narrative. The sheer banality of Charles’s remark, neatly juxtaposed with the solemnity of what was undoubtedly the most important diplomatic occasion of his reign, brings home the quandary facing the French throughout the period covered by this book (1399-1422). At a time when all secular power and authority was vested in the monarch, what do you do when he is unfit to rule? \r\n\r\nFor 30 years, ever since his first episode in 1392, Charles had suffered from intermittent and increasingly lengthy periods of mental illness that left him, in Sumption’s own arresting phrase, “a mannequin of authority, at once indispensable and useless”. Charles’s mental “absences” created a void at the heart of government, which his greedy relatives fought each other to fill. \r\n\r\nThe king’s brother, Louis of Orléans, built up vast estates and acquired royal revenues which formed nine-tenths of his income; his greatest rival, their uncle Philip of Burgundy, used his ascendancy to siphon off more than a tenth of the crown’s annual revenues into his own private purse. Neither of them could afford to allow the other to acquire exclusive control of the king’s person, but what began as a political battle for access to the crown’s largesse became a bitter blood feud between the houses of Orléans and Burgundy after the murder of Louis of Orléans by Philip’s son John in 1407. Their personal quarrel dragged the kingdom into the abyss of a civil war that, even by the standards of the day, was extraordinarily brutal, with the defeated executed as traitors by their fellow countrymen.', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1'),

Her mother was a shoe designer for Delman, and Marchetto would sketch “fabulous women” like the ones she saw in the trend reports her mom compiled. “The first drawing I ever did was of a shoe,” Marchetto tells Vogue.com by phone. It wasn’t until her family took a vacation to Bermuda, and ended up inside a house that belonged to the legendary cartoonist James Thurber, with some of his work hanging on the walls, that she realized that she could add words to her images. “That was an epiphany.”\r\n\r\nBut then Marchetto grew up, and was hired at the advertising firm J. Walter Thompson. (Her boss was then creative director James Patterson: “Everybody would be like, ‘Oh, Jim, he gets up early in the morning to write these books. . . . Do you think they’ll ever go anywhere?’ ”) The commercials she worked on featured the type of women she once sketched; to the chagrin of her superiors, she found the ladies in the ads far more fascinating than the products she was being paid to promote. She was miserable.\r\n\r\nThen, another epiphany: On New Year’s Eve of her 30th year, “I lit a votive candle and channeled all the higher spirits. I would write in my journal all the things I wanted for the [coming] year.” She found herself doodling a picture of a woman with a gun in her mouth, captioned with the line: “‘She was a little upset during the meeting.” Click. “I was like, Oh, my God! I should have been a cartoonist all along!’” Carried away, Marchetto leaned over her journal and lit her dangling tresses on fire. “I had long frayed hair,” she remembers, laughing. “Sort of angled, but all one length. I had to get a shag.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a story that carries extra resonance in the context of Marchetto’s new book, Ann Tenna, the follow-up to Cancer Vixen, her 2006 memoir about receiving a breast cancer diagnosis just ahead of her wedding to her now-husband, Da Silvano restauranteur Silvano Marchetto. The new novel is about a striving, attention-addicted, body image—obsessed woman named Ann Tenna, founder of a sinister Gawker-like gossip site called Eyemauler. At the top of the dirt-digging media heap, Ann thinks she’s got it made—a glamorous career, sycophantic friends, an engagement to a sleazy, in-high-demand party photographer named Zim—until she gets into a horrible car accident, suffers a traumatic brain injury, and goes into a coma. While unconscious, she visits a higher realm, meets her other half, the cosmic Super Ann, and gets her orders from above: Go back to earth and become transmissionary, a beacon of love and light in a world overrun by mean-spirited gossip and the technological devices that help keep us addicted to it. She also learns that her unruly red hair actually serves a very important purpose: It’s an antenna that will help her communicate with the spectral Super Ann, and communicate her messages of enlightenment to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nBack on earth, Ann wakes up to find her head partially shaved from brain surgery (she fixes that situation not with a shag, but with a groovy, assymetrical, Ziggy Stardust–inspired mullet) and the voice of Super Ann constantly in her ear, reminding her of her mission. Can she separate out her own sense of self-worth from constant media adulation? Can she see Zim for the dirtbag he really is? Can she disconnect from the empty life she once loved in order to fully reconnect with her higher self? No spoilers here: Read the book.

Stay tuned – later we will look at how you can use honey at home with some fabulous DIY beauty tips (like the honey turmeric mask) and home remedies as well as some delicious healthy recipes.', 'What is honey?\r\nA quick refresher… Honey is a sweet food that bees make using sugary nectar collected from flowers. They transform this nectar into honey through a regurgitation process (sounds a bit gross I know – basically they process it until it reaches a desired quality), and this is stored in wax honeycombs inside a beehive. The bees then fan the honeycomb to encourage evaporation of water – this prevents fermentation. Pretty clever, huh? The raw honey that beekeepers collect from the hive has a long shelf life and won’t ferment if it is sealed well.\r\n \r\nDid you know that honey won’t freeze solid? It just becomes really thick and sluggish at low temperatures. Don’t we all!?\r\n \r\nThere are many different types of honey – each with a unique flavour, appearance and quality – this is determined by what flowers the bees have been visiting. You can buy either a pure floral honey or a commercial blend (different types mixed together). Honey is processed in many ways – so you can end up with a lot of different forms of honey including crystallized honey, pasteurized honey, raw honey, strained honey, filtered honey, ultrasonicated honey, whipped honey, dried honey, comb honey and chunk honey. Phew!\r\n \r\nHoney nutrition\r\nHoney maintains most of it’s vitamins and minerals if kept raw and unheated . As there are so many different types of honey, the nutritional composition and quality varies. Honey can contain calcium, zinc, iron, Vitamin C, magnesium, potassium and B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5 & B6). It is a natural energy booster, since it is mostly (around 84%) made up of sugars – glucose and fructose, which leads us to our next question…\r\n \r\nHoney vs sugar – which is healthier?\r\nWhile honey contains the same basic sugar units as table sugar, it is chemically different – in table sugar the glucose and fructose are linked together, while in honey they remain separate. A lot of processed food tends to contain granulated sugar with high levels of fructose which converts to fat more easily than honey. No thanks! Honey takes longer to digest than sugar and offers more sustained energy – it has a low to medium GI (pure honey has a lower GI than blended honey) and some athletes even use honey to help performance endurance and ease muscle fatigue. Research has shown that honey keeps blood sugar levels more constant than other types of sugar. In addition, honey is less processed than sugar and contains more minerals and vitamins. Even though honey is generally considered more healthy than sugar, it’s not a free ticket to have as much as you want! We should consume all sugars in moderation – including honey. Honey actually has more calories than table sugar but we tend to use it less because it tastes sweeter.\r\n \r\nHoney has antioxidant properties (it can remove free radicals from the body) and can improve the digestive system. It is considered by many as an all-round health and immune system booster. There are some claims that honey may have anti-tumour properties and may prevent carcinogens, but this is not scientifically proven.\r\n \r\nWhen you are shopping for honey to eat, check the labels for raw (minimally processed and not heated, so it retains vitamins and minerals) and pure (lower GI than blended honey). Raw honey is so good for you that many people call it a superfood!\r\n \r\nMedicinal benefits of honey\r\nHoney has traditionally been used to treat a variety of ailments and is found in many natural home remedies. Recent scientific research (like the work done by the Waikato Honey Research Unit) is confirming the nutritional and medicinal properties of natural honey and how it can be used in modern medicine.', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1'),

But thinking about it now, the barefoot aspect is a big part of why I like it – it’s the feeling of freedom, simplicity and connecting with nature. I love all kinds of beach sports and inherently barefoot exercise like yoga, pilates and swimming, and I can’t wait to try stand up paddle boarding (hope to do this very soon). At home and in the garden, I’m pretty much always barefoot, except for Wintery nights when I keep my feet warm with some nice thick wool socks. I don’t really do high heels. So now that I think about it, I’m pretty keen on the whole barefoot thing already. At a school camp to Fraser Island (which is stunning), I was fascinated by our guide who told us he had been barefoot for many years, except for formal occasions. I think I even took a photo of his feet (when he wasn’t looking)! And having grown up in South Africa in the 80′s, I saw Zola Budd – a South African runner who famously raced barefoot.\r\n\r\nBut I’ve never really considered running around the streets barefoot. It doesn’t seem practical, I think I’d be too worried about watching the path for rocks, glass and the like to enjoy the run. So when I heard about “barefoot” running shoes, or minimalist running shoes – that sparked my interest.\r\n \r\nWhy all the fuss over barefoot running?\r\nBarefoot running, also called natural running uses a different running form to the one we usually adopt when running with cushioned running shoes. When running barefoot, you land on the middle or ball of your foot, with a bent knee – as opposed to “normal” running, where you typically land with a longer stride, on your heel with your leg straight out in front of you. Barefoot advocates argue that the biomechanics of barefoot running result in less impact to your joints and body, and may help runners avoid chronic injuries caused by the impact of heel striking. They also claim that regularly running barefoot strengthens the arch of your food, which can naturally help dampen the impact of running. By adopting a good barefoot running technique, you can expect better balance, stability, lighter impact and increased propulsion. Many barefoot runners are inspired by the book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall, which follows a tribe of barefoot distance runners in Mexico.', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1'),

By this I mean eating slowly and thoughtfully – appreciating the smell, flavour, texture of each bite. And more than that… Also pausing to think about the food – where it came from, how it was grown, who prepared it and how it was made. When you think about it, a lot of people probably put in a lot of effort to grow the food and get it from the farm to your plate. Don’t we owe them the respect of truly appreciating each mouthful instead of mindlessly wolfing it down?', 'Why is chewing so important?\r\nChewing is the first step of digestion. If food is not chewed well, the rest of the digestion process can suffer. There are two main reasons for this. First of all, chewing increases the surface area of the food. Secondly, saliva helps start digesting food – it contains enzymes that start breaking down carbohydrates and fats. It also helps move the food through your gut. The more you chew, the easier it will be to digest later on. On top of that, it is thought that the longer you savour your food through seeing, smelling and tasting – the more your body will be prepared to fully digest it. Complete digestion means that you’ll be reaping the benefits of absorbing all the nutrients out of the food, rather than them going to waste. There’s not much point in eating super healthy food if your body isn’t going to be able to make the most out of all those nutrients!\r\nWhy eating too fast can be bad for your health\r\nWhen you eat too fast, your body may not be able to fully digest the food. Incomplete digestion is not easy on the stomach and can cause a few problems, including heartburn, stomach pain, bloating, gas, wind and other indigestion discomfort. The long term effects of poor digestion can lead to health problems including nutrient deficiencies and food sensitivities. If food isn’t digested properly, it can lead to bacterial overgrowth in your gut which can cause wind. This is especially important for people who eat a lot of red meat, as it is quite dense and difficult to break down. Throwing down a meal in seconds can also increase the risk of choking, as large pieces of food can get lodged in the windpipe. And finally… Fast eating also means that you are probably swallowing a bit of air with your food, which can make you gassy and bloated.

It''s making a Dislike button — or something like it — and it''s apparently going to head into testing soon. "People have asked about the ''Dislike'' button for many years ... and today is a special day, because today is the day that I actually get to say we are working on it and are very close to shipping a test of it," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said today during a public Q&A session, according to CNBC.\r\n\r\nThere aren''t a lot of details beyond that, but Zuckerberg says that Facebook''s goal is to implement the button in a way that makes it a tool to "express empathy" — as in, to Dislike a sad moment that a friend shared — than a way to hurt someone. So while Zuckerberg may have called it a "Dislike" button, what Facebook is building may approximate better to a button for sharing compassion when a thumbs up is socially inappropriate.\r\n\r\n"We don''t want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people''s posts," Zuckerberg said. "That doesn''t seem like the kind of community that we want to create: you don''t want to go through the process of sharing some moment that was important to you in your day and have someone downvote it." Basically, he doesn''t want to turn Facebook into Reddit, which, given Reddit''s recent troubles, seems like a solid course of action.\r\n\r\nUpdate September 15th, 4:55PM ET: This story has been updated to elaborate on how Facebook could implement "Dislike" in ways other than as an explicit button', 'null', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1'),

I don’t miss them at all, as they were redundant and took up screen space.\r\n\r\nAlso new is greatly improved sharing. Save your file to OneDrive, and you can then use a sharing button to invite people via their email address, copy a link you can then email to others, or send the workbook as either a PDF or native workbook attachment. Recipients can (assuming you grant permission) edit your file, even if they don’t own Excel, through Microsoft’s web-hosted Excel app.\r\n\r\nFans of pivot tables will find a new slicer tool that greatly increases the usability of pivot tables. A slicer is a way to limit the data you see in a pivot table. In a pivot table showing years of sales by salesperson, for example, you can use slicers to restrict the table to one or more years, or to one or more salespeople.

And now, thanks to New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s new computer science mandate, the battle between the two coasts may have just swung a bit in the east’s favor.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Mayor De Blasio announced that all city public schools will have to offer computer science to all their students within the next decade, and while it will not be a graduation requirement for high schoolers, the change marks a distinct effort to expand computer literacy and further opportunities for New York youth with an increasingly important skill set.\r\n\r\nThe move comes as part of a broader education plan, which the mayor announced in a comprehensive speech Wednesday evening. Computer science and programming, though, is certainly a major focus for the politician, who noted that, “A computer science education is literacy for the 21st century. When you do find students in computer class, they’re learning word processing or typing when they should be learning how to code.”\r\n\r\nRelated: The best desktop computers money can buy\r\n\r\nThe expansion of computer science classes will be no small undertaking — over the next 10 years, the city plans to spend $81 million to help train a sufficient number of teachers to actually offer the curriculum. As of today, fewer than 10 percent of schools in the city offer any sort of computer science course, and only 1 percent of students manage to graduate having taken such a class.\r\n\r\nBut with growing concerns over the lack of diversity in the tech industry, particularly when it comes to engineering and programming roles, the need for greater access to these skills is becoming more and more pronounced. Parents certainly seem to be on board with the changes, with parents like Jennifer Rivera telling local CBS2 News, “I do think it’s very important for the kids. [My son] wants to be a scientist when he gets older, so it’ll be awesome for him.”\r\n\r\nAnother parent, Yakema Brisman, told the news station, “For my kids and considering the changing times, I want them to be able to keep up with it and do it safely.”\r\n\r\nSo while it may have just been reading, writing, and arithmetic when we were in school, children of the 21st century are receiving an education that is including literacy in a brand new subject — computers.\r\n', 'null', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1');
